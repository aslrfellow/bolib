Static libraries, while reusable in multiple programs, are locked into a program at compile time. Dynamic, or shared libraries on the other hand, exist as separate files outside of the executable file. ... In contrast, a dynamic library can be modified without a need to re-compile.

c11 vs c99

C11 is the latest ANSI C specification, ISO/IEC 9899:2011. C11 looked to address the issues of C99 and to more closely match the C++ standard, C++11. It changes some C99 features required to optional. Some of the features include variable length arrays and complex numbers. This makes it easier for compiler vendors to meet C11â€™s required function set.

C99, ANSI C
The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, also known as C99, was released in 1999 and adopted in 2000.
